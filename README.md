Vending.js is a web application suite consisting of an api server and a React-based progressive web application. The primary use is to allow customers of a service (in this case vending machines) to post complaints about a machine in a streamlined manner. It also has separate admin and technician interfaces to view complaints, appointments, active technicians and the real-time locations of technicians (not available in beta mode).

The standout feature is the server-side algorithm that calculates the best technician for an appointment based on their real-time locations and the matrix formed by their existing appointments. This algorithm is explained in further detail.
